To separate a graph by two different beaches, you can use faceting in ggplot2. The function used for this is either facet_wrap() or facet_grid(). These functions split the graph into multiple panels based on a variableâ€”in your case, the beach name.

Here's how you can create a graph for two beaches, separated into different panels:


# add facet_wrap()
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  # Rotate x-axis labels
  facet_wrap(~ `Beach Name`)  # This separates the graph by each beach

  
Explanation:
facet_wrap(~ Beach Name): This tells ggplot2 to create separate panels for each unique value in the Beach Name column.
The rest of the code remains similar to what you had for creating a bar chart, with facet_wrap() splitting the plot by beach name.
